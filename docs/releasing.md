# Releasing

`@astilba/tokens` and `@astilba/ui` currently share a version and release together. A release is built from a tag whose commit is already on `main`; the release workflow verifies the repository, packs both packages once, records their checksums, and publishes those exact artifacts in dependency order.

## Release a version

1. Update both package versions to the intended semver version.
2. Merge the change through a pull request with the required checks.
3. Publish a GitHub release whose tag is `v<version>` and targets the merged commit on `main`.
4. Confirm the `Release` workflow verifies and publishes both packages.
5. Verify the registry versions, provenance attestations, and a clean consumer install.

If a published release fails, never delete, move, recreate, or reuse its tag or version. Fix the failure through a pull request, advance both packages to the next shared version, and publish a new release from the verified `main` commit.

The npm environment and trusted-publisher configuration authorize only `.github/workflows/release.yml` in `astilbahq/ui`. The publish job runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with an OIDC identity and no long-lived npm credential.

The first public release is the only exception: npm requires a package to exist before trusted publishing can be configured. Bootstrap it with the least-privilege temporary npm credential that can create both packages. Store the credential only as a protected `npm` environment secret; never commit or print it. Once both packages exist, configure trusted publishing, disallow token publishing, delete the environment secret, and revoke the credential immediately.
